Infertility is said to occur when one fails to conceive after one year of successful unprotected intercourse. Moreover, since you have conceived once, so it is appropriate for you to wait for at least three months before undergoing any infertility investigations and management. Chances to conceive in each menstrual cycle is only 20-25 %, therefore do not take stress and try for natural conception for at least next3-4 months. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health.

Thanks for writing to Ask Apollo.
You have had two abortion and it has been 8 months since your last abortion. It is not a good idea to get pregnant at this point of time.
Your periods are regular and you have had brown blood clots, which means you are not ovulating.
You should wait at least 6-12 months before trying to conceive again.
You should take the following tests:

1. Complete hemogram
2. Thyroid function tests
3. Ultrasound to check for uterine fibroids
4. USG of both ovaries

"I am an 87yr old lady and when I had to have my appendicitis out last summer a small cancer was found onn one of my kidney s i chose to leave it alone, and tthe Dr agreed with me, this year when I had a ultra sound it had grown about a centimeter again I chose to leave it alone , wondering if I did the right thing/ ,","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you have done correct thing. At your age it is not advisable to diagnose malignancy and start chemotherapy and radiotherapy as these will not improve your life expectancy. Any treatment or work up is worth doing if it improves life expectancy and reduce suffering s. But this is not true for your age. Infact chemo and radiotherapy will harm you more than they are not routine medicines, they are highly toxic Chat Doctor. So I advise to leave it as it is and if you are symptomatic in future than go for palliative treatment.","I am an 87yr old lady and when I had to have my appendicitis out last summer a small cancer was found onn one of my kidney s i chose to leave it alone, and tthe Dr agreed with me, this year when I had a ultra sound it had grown about a centimeter again I chose to leave it alone , wondering if I did the right thing/ , I am not a Dr but I am a nurse and I have been in the medical field for 50 years, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and I have had a lot of surgery, I have had a lot of cancer and",You may be fine but it would make sense to see a doctor and have this evaluated.
"Hi. I have had my tubes tied for 2 years and ever since then my periods have been every 29-31 days. I recently decided that I wanted to get on depo because i have heard of  cases of pregnancy with your tubes tied. I had my depo shot on March 27 and was due for period anywhere between April 10-12. Around that time I had cramping like i was going to come on my period but it never came. Could that have been a side effect of depo? Also this morning i was really dizzy and I had to sit still, now I have a bad headache because of the dizziness. could that be a side effect of the depo also?","Hi, Your symptoms could be due to the effect of the demo shot since you did not time it with your cycle. Your period may get delayed or may not come at all as happens in some people. The headache and dizziness could be related to the effect of the hormone, and you should get your blood pressure and other vital data checked to see if you need any medical assistance. If you continue having persistent discomfort you should report to your consultant and switch to some other contraception. Take care.","Hi.

I am going to call my doctor tomorrow but I am just wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them.","Hi,
You might have a slight hormonal shift with your first depo shot but not enough to cause your period to stop for a full cycle. I would wait and see if you have your period in the next 2 weeks. If"

I am not a doctor but I do have a background in medicine. The numbness in your feet could be related to a circulatory problem or a problem with the nerves that control your feet. You should have your blood pressure checked again and also have a blood test for cholesterol. If you are taking a statin for your cholesterol, then you should have a check on your liver enzymes as well. The low BP could be caused by a low iron level or low vitamin B12. You should have a blood test for your iron level and also your vitamin B12 level.

The night sweats could be related"
